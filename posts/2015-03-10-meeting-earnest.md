One of the most difficult things about choosing where you work is getting a complete
picture of what it‘s _really_ like there. What are the people like? What are their values? What are the types of challenges they get to work on day to day? There’s only so much that a career page and job description can expose. In the past, I’ve learned the most about companies from talking to the people that work there.

If you’ve ever been curious about [Earnest](https://www.meetearnest.com/) — especially the Data or Engineering teams — you’ve now got an ongoing chance to learn more by talking to me. You may already know that we’re building a next-generation bank leveraging technology and data sciences. Now you can get answers to all of your other questions.

Starting this Wednesday, (March 18, 2015) every week I’ll be working from a different San Francisco coffee shop from 8am until 10am. The complete schedule is:

- _Wednesday March 18, 2015 8am — 10am_: [Specialty’s at 1 Post Street](http://www.specialtys.com/Location.aspx?Store=SF03) right next to Montgomery station
- _Thursday March 26, 2015 8am — 10am_: [The Creamery](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-creamery-san-francisco-3) in SOMA
- _Tuesday March 31, 2015 8am — 10am_: [Starbucks](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Starbucks/@37.762882,-122.410483,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xf9def5f43897ba31) at Bryant and Mariposa in Mission/Potrero
- _Thursday April 9, 2015 8am — 10am_: [The Creamery](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-creamery-san-francisco-3) in SOMA

If you’d like to stop by and chat about anything — from engineering practices at Earnest to how we think about using data to model risk feel free to stop by. It’s a no-pressure, no-sales environment where I’d be happy to answer any questions you have and give you a sense for what we’re all about.

You can find out exactly where I’ll be by checking the Earnest [Twitter](https://twitter.com/meetearnest) account.
(Or you can [message me](https://twitter.com/bromanko) directly.) We’ll get the information out a few days in advance.

I hope you’ll stop by and say hello.
